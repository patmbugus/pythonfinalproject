# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This notebook analyzes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. We will clean and process the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends across countries and time.

# 1. Import Required Libraries

We will use pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and optionally plotly for interactive maps.

## 2. Load and Preview COVID-19 Dataset

Let's load the 'owid-covid-data.csv' file and preview its contents.

# 3. Explore Data Structure and Missing Values

We will inspect the dataset's shape, data types, and count missing values in each column.
